## steps
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create a new project
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
Delete all files in the src/ folder of the new project (donâ€™t delete the folder, just its contents).
rm -f src/*
Add a file named index.css in the src/ folder with this CSS code.
Add a file named index.js in the src/ folder with this JS code.
Add these three lines to the top of index.js in the src/ folder:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
```
